// Memory //


Notes:
	A collection of cells, with a unique physical address, as storage units are
grouped together by 8 bits holding a one or zero.

Memory Addressiblity:
	The number of bits in each addressable location, called the memories addressability,
as most PCs are byte-addressable nowadays. 
					₃₂
Ex: A 32 bit machine could distinguish 2   memory addresses. The cells in memory are
numbered conseculetively beginning with 0


Ex: Below is a table of bits the processor can distinguish with their location.
		    ₙ
ₙ bits can address 2  locations 
Below example is, Addressibility is 8 bits and 256 cells.

We must apply an interpretation on any bit pattern to determine the information
it repersents. The bits are numbered from right to left beginning with zero.
