// Fetch and Execute //


STEPS IN PROCESSING CYCLE
// 1. FETCH NEXT INSTRUCTION ∞ Program counter contains address in memory, control unit goes to address memory makes copy to registers, counter updated.
// 2. DECODE THE INSTRUCTION ∞ Determines the instruction(see NOTE number 2), instruction then decoded into control signals(see NOTE 3), then passes 
	instruction to registers.
// 3. GET DATA IF NEEDED ∞ Gets decoded data from registers, and fetches any operands(data), then passes into ALU(see NOTE 4).
// 4. EXECUTE THE INSTRUCION ∞ After steps 1-3 are completed, the process is ready to execute the instruction, so it sends signals to the circuitry, then
 	stores a copy into memory after the execution of the process' complete. 



Note:

// 1. Accessing memory takes one cycle.
// 2. Keyboard signals or to perform some operation on a data value.
// 3. The logic of the circuitry in the CPU, which determines which operation to be 
executed. Which the instructions themselves are literally built into the circuits.
// 4. Arithmetic Logic unit
