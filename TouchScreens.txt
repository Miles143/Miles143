// Touch Screens //



Note: 
	Other input/output (I/O) devices allow human user interaction with an exectuing
	program. Barcode readers, image scanners, printers and plotters are examples of (I/O)'s.

	Ex: 
		resistive touch screen, is made up of two layers, one vertical lines and second 
		horizontal lines of electrically conductive material. When pressed the electrical
		current begins to flow.
		
		capacitive touch screen, has a laminent over a glass screen. The laminent conducts
		electricity in all directions

		infrared touch screen, projects crisscrossing horizontal and vertical beams of infrared
		light just over the surface of the screen. Sensors on opposite sides detect the beams.

		surface acoustic wave (SAW) touch screen, is similar to infrared, except it projects high
		freuency sound waves across the horizontal, and vertical axis'. Interruption is the detection.

		
Note: 
	A gloved hand could be used in resistive, infrared, and SAW touch screens but cannot be used with 
	capacitive touch screens, which rely on current flowing to the touch point.
