// start at the rightmost binary digit and mark the digits in groups of threes from right to left //

ex:

111	101	100	<- binary grouped into three digits at a time to calculate into octal digits
___	___	___
 7	 5 	 4	<- octal values of above binary

— •   • •   — • —   — • —   • •

example: lets convert the binary number 1010110 to octal and then convert it to decimal. 
when catagorizing into groups of three you want to count right to left three digits at a time.

1 010 110 <- binary number grouped into three digits at a time from right to left.  
_ ___ ___
1  2   6  <- remember this is the octal equvilent(1,2, and 6) Now, -> convert that to decimal.

  1 * (8)2 = 1 * 64 = 64
+ 2 * (8)1 = 2 * 8 =  16
+ 6 * (8)0 = 6 * 1 =   6 
		              86
		              
// the decimal, hex and octal values should be the same for 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit //
