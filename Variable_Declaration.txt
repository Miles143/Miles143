Ex:	
	Languages				Variable Declaration
	Ada				sum : Float := 0;--set up word with 0 as contents
					num1: Integer;	--set up a two-byte block for num1
					num2: Integer;	--set up a two-byte block for num2
					num3: Integer;	--set up a two-byte block for num3
					...
					num1:= 1;

	VB.NET				Dim sum As Single = 0.0F ' set up word with 0 as contents
					Dim num1 As Integer ' set up a two-byte block for num1
					Dim num2 As Integer ' set up a two-byte block for num2
					Dim num3 As Integer ' set up a two-byte block for num3
					...
					num1 = 1

	C++/Java			float sum = 0.0;	//set up word with 0 as contents
					int num1;		//set up a block for num1
					int num2;		//set up a block for num2
					int num3;		//set up a block for num3
					...
					num1 = 1;

Notes:
(1)Ada uses ":=", but Ada closes out with ";", 
(2) VB.NET uses "=", but VB.NET does NOT close out with ";"
(3)C++/Java uses "=", but java also closes out with ";".
(1)uses Float
(2)uses Sinlge or Double
(3)uses int

ALL of these example languages allows use to store an initial value in the location assigned to the identifier
	by placing the assignment operator & value immediately following the declaration. (Side NOTE: declaration-
	- is a statement that associates an identifier with a variable an action or some other entity with in the 
	language that can be given a name, so the programmer can refer to by name.)
(*)lexicographical order (also known as lexical order, or dictionary order) is a generalization of the alphabetical order.
