File System
Notes:
	A file is a named collection of related data. A file is the smallest amount 
	of data that can be written to secondary memory. The file system is the 
	organization of the the collection of files, while grouping them is called a
	directory. Each diretory contains a table that records info about the files.
	Some files have a rigid format, while others are more flexible.	A file must 
	be opened before rw properties are preformed. At any point and time an open 
	file has a current file pointer(an address) indicating the place where the 
	next rw operation should occur. Reading a file the means the os dilivers a
	copy of the info in the file, starting at the current file pointer. After rw
	occurs the file pointer is updated. Appending info to the end of a file, 
	requires that the file pointer be positioned at the end of a file, Trunicating
	(deleting) the contents of a file without removing the administrative entries
	 in the file tables.

Disk Scheduling/
	CPU Scheduling 
Notes:
	Latency: the additional time it takes the platter to rotate into the proper
	position so that the info can be read/written, seek time: the amount of time
	it takes for the heads to reach the appropriate cylinder. SCAN: the read/write
	heads move toward the spindle. Circular SCAN: algorithm, when it reaches one extreme
	it returns all the way back. LOOK disk-scheduling: alorithm looks ahead to see whether
	the heads should continue in the current direction.

Directories
Notes:
	The directory must be able to list all the files in the directory. Also a 
	directory must be able to reflect(table) the relationships amongst. 
	
	Directory Trees
	Notes:
		First a Parent Directory, then subdirectory(nested directories) thus
		creating a heiracrchy structure, mostly viewed as a directory tree,
		with the highest level called a root directory. The idea of containment
		is when the analogy of folders to repersent the directory structure, 
		promoting the ideal of containment. Files in different directories
		may have the same name, but may not contain the same data. 		<-----note*

		Path names
		Notes:
			We must be able to specify file locations using text, this is important
			because of instructions stored in batch command files. To actually indicate
//			a file using text we specify the file's path(absolute: '\' begins at root, or 						//
//			relative: '/' current working directory)(in most os' '..' is used to specify						//
//			the parent directory, and '.' is used to specify the current working directory)						//
		
Text and Binary
Notes:
	Broadly, all files can be classified as either text or binary. In a text file
	the bytes are data, either ASCII or Unicode mostly. A file no matter the type
	must specifically be interpreted individually. A information is stored as binary
	digits, usually chunks of 8 or 16 bits, interpreted as characters, or possibly
	another special format. Some info lends itself as character repersentation, usually
	making the format Plaintext or readable. A program written in a high-level language 
	is stored as a 	text file(source file), may also use: txt, cpp, c, java.

File Access
Notes:
	Two primary access techniques: sequencial access, and direct access. Sequencial
	access views a file as a linear structure, and info processed in order. Direct
	access are conceptually divided into numbered logical records.
