// Ram and Rom //


Note:
	Random Access Memory. Ram is memory in which each cell can be direcly accessed usually a byte. Inheriting
the idea of being able to access each location is the abiity to change it contents. An instruction can be changed
while a program is executing instruction. This only takes place, when an additional instruction takes the contents
of a location, and adds or subtracts a value from it and returns it. Ram can also be called RWM read/write memory.
	Read Only Memory. The contents in Rom cannot being changed. The locations have its permanent contents but
only can be changed by means of placing a bit pattern in Rom called burning it. This takes place at manufacturing
time/assembly time. **Rom is also Random access memory, because ALL main memory is random access.

	RAM is volatile.			ROM is not.
	Ram does not retain it's bit		Rom does retain it's bit
	configuration when power is off.	configuration when power is off.
						Rom is stable, and its instruction
						is permanent, because this is needed
						to start the pc.
