// Circuits //



Combining Gates into circuits. Circuits have two seperate categaories, 
combinational circuit, and sequential circuit. 

In a Combinational circuit, the
input values explicitly determine the output.

In a Sequential Circuit, the output is a function of the input values as well as
the existing state of the circuit, usually invovling the storage of information,
called sequential memory circuits.
