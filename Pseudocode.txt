// Pseudocode //



	Notes:
		1. A pseudocode algorithim is a set of instructions for how to solve
		a particular problem. 2. Problem solving is the act of finding a solution
		to a perplexing, distressning, vexing or unsettled question. A problem is
		as a question raised for inquiry, consideration, or solution. In mathematics,
		a problem is usually a situation to resolve with well-defined mathematical principals.
		A human (the programmer) must analyze the problem, develope the instructions for solving
		the problem (the program), and then have the computer carry out the instructions. The 
		computer can then repeat the instruction, agian and agian, for different situations and data.
