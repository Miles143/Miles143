Notes: 
	1. A parallel processing system, having the capability to process more data
	at faster speeds, by having multiple processors applying the same program
	to multiple different data sets, this is called synchronous processing. Similar to
	Nasa's backup topology which has three computers doing the same processing
	as a security measure. 2. Another configuration arranges processors in tandom, 
	where each contributes a part to an overall computation, and this is called
	pipelining, exactly like an assembly line. 3. A third example would be having 
	different processors, doing different things to different data sets, this is called
	shared-memory configuration.
	
Ex:	#1				Control

	Ex: Below is an example regarding notes #2.
					     	      a. The first processor does the task.
				↓
		result from 1st processor	 →    b. The second processor starts working on the output
							from the first processor.
				↓
		result from 2nd processor	 →    c. The third processor applies its computation to the
							next data set.
				↓
		final result from 3rd processor  →··· d. The nth processor
