// Gates with more inputs/Constructing Gates //


This example gate will be a simple AND gate, with 3 inputs instead its normal 
2 input scenario.

Ex:

X = A ·	B ·	C

				A     
				  --►
				B    
				  --►   --► X
				C     
				  --►

Constructing Gates
	Transistors: a device that acts, depending on the voltage level of an input, 
	either as a wire that conducts electricity or as a resistor that blocks the
	flow of electricity. A transistor has three terminals: a source, a base,
	and an eitter. Emitter is typically ground wire(Black), the source is usually the
	output wire(Red), the base is "input/throughput" wire. If the base signal is 
	high (close to a +5 voltage), as long as the ground is grounded the transistor
	is off, which leads to a signal at the source wire.
