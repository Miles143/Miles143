// Repersenting Color //


Our retinas have three color type red, green, blue. All other colors can be made 
perceptible to our eyes combining these colors. These work on a  color frequency
scaling from 0 to 255.

Ex:
three demensional color space.
RGB(255, 255, 255) // white <-- 255 is the color depth. expressed in number of bits.
RGB(255, 0, 0) // red
RGB(0, 255, 0) // green
RGB(0, 0, 255) // blue
RGB(0, 0, 0) // black 

Ex-2:
Hi-Color repersented in 16 bit color depth. Five bits for each red, green, blue,
and a single bit for transparency.

Ex-3:
TrueColor repersented in 24 bit color depth. 8 bit delegation for each red, green, 
blue. The palette color closest to the true color is selected, and displayed.
Bitmap uses 24 bit TrueColor.

Vector Graphics:
Repersentation of an image in terms of lines and shapes.
Vector formatting is scalable vector graphics (SVG).
Used in web-based imaging.
