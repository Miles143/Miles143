Notes: 
	Secondary also known as auxiliary storage devices ex:(1.magnetic tape drives, 2.magnetic
disks), a tape recorder is an example of a 1.magnetic tape drives, as a compact disk could be could be 
considered a magnetic disk, which rather than having concentric tracks, sprials from inside out.  In 
example 2, the information is stored in sectors, each sector holds a block of information. A normal 
sector in a CD-DA* contains 1/75 seconds of audio information, data is stored in the sectors reserved 
for timing information in CD-DA. Each disk has it's own read/write head, all the tracks that line up 
under one another are called a cylinder. A cylinder number , the surface number, and the sector, is the
address.



* CD-DA, CD-ROM, CD-WORM, CD-RW <---- the differences are the formatting.
CD-WORM = write once read many <---- typically used for archiving.

1. contains less data then example no. 2. As an sd card would contain less data then a hard drive.
