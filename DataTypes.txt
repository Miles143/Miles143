Data Types In Lexicographic Order with general notes:
	
	Boolean: not all high-level programming languages support the Boolean data type,
		in that case use 1, or 0.

		Characters: the meaning of "less than" & "greater than", when applied to characters is "comes before", "comes after"
			in the character set (ex: 1 is less than 2, 2 is less than 3, ect.)

		
			Integers: some languages have 2 symbols for division, 1 to return a real #, other to return integer quotient #.
				modulus operator=returns Integer remainder.
				
				Reals: most languages have 2 signs of real #s, real & integer, real #s are often  not exact.

					Strings: in a string **"this is a string"** <-- (from ** to ** is one value).


Notes:

When you want to compare character A to 1 you must look up the relationship between these characters in the character set you are using, ascii, unicode ect.
